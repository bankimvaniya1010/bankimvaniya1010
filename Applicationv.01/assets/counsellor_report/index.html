                     <p>When addressing the risk factors identified in Section 2 of this report, it is better to be honest and transparent about them rather than attempt to be dishonest or to not disclose the facts. Honesty and transparency is important because these qualities breed trust. Trust in turn produces confidence in the decision-maker, which is likely to encourage him/her/them to give you the benefit of the doubt by approving your application thereby giving you the opportunity to fulfil your goals.</p>
                     <p> If you are either dishonest, or, if you fail to disclose a key piece of information, and the decision-maker gets to find out the truth during the assessment, the decision-maker will not trust you and will almost certainly reject your application. </p>
                     <p>An extreme case of dishonesty is "fraud".  In the context of your student visa and course application, fraud can be defined as:<br><b><i>"Fraud - Intentional deception or perversion of truth in order to induce the decision-maker to grant  you admission into a course, or to grant you a student visa".</i></b></p>
                     <p>
                        Needless to say, fraud is a serious offence. You will do well to avoid any temptation to commit any fraudulent act because the penalties are severe. For example, in 
                        <Country of study>
                        , if your student visa application is found to be fraudulent, not only will your visa application be refused, but you could also potentially face a minimum of a 3-year ban from travelling to 
                        <Country of study>
                        .
                     </p>
                     <p>As you can imagine, the costs associated with being dishonest are too high. Honesty is always the  best approach in life and it is with principle in mind that we make the following recommendations on how to address the risk factors identified in your GTE Direct Assessment.</p>

If a decision-maker suspects that you are applying for this student visa for any other outcomes other than study outcomes, he or she is likely to reject your application on the basis of them suspecting you to be a non-genuine student and a non-genuine temporary entrant.

So, you do not want to have a track record of not completing your studies or not complying with your visa conditions, particularly before completing the course(s) that you committed to when accepting your offer letter.
