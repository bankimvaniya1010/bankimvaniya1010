<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you hold a student visa and wish to change education provider, you may need to seek the department’s permission first. You must seek permission if your visa is subject to condition 8206 and you wish to change education provider either:
<ul>
<li>while studying any preliminary courses; or</li>
<li>during the first 12 months of your principal course.</li>
</ul>
If you wish to change education provider but continue studying the same type of course, you must apply on form 157C <i>Application for a student visa with permission to change education provider.</i>
</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you wish to change both your provider and the type of course you are studying, you must apply for a new student visa using this form (form 157A).</div>

department while your application is being processed you
should read information form 1025i <i>Making and processing
visa applications</i>, which is available from your nearest
Australian Government office or the department’s website</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">All student visa applicants must satisfy the criteria for grant of one of the student visa subclasses. These criteria include (but are not limited to) financial ability, English language proficiency, intention to comply with visa conditions and other relevant matters. Information on these criteria and the conditions that may be attached to your visa can be found in the information form 1160i <i>Applying for a student visa</i> and on the department’s website.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp"><b>Note:</b> If you are required to provide the results of an English language test, <b>you must sit the test before you lodge your visa application</b>. If you sit a test after you have lodged your application, the results of this test cannot be taken into account.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you wish to study in Australia, your application will be assessed against one of 5 assessment levels for each visa subclass. Before completing this form, you must refer to information form 1219i <i>Overseas Student Program – Assessment Levels</i> for information on which Assessment Level applies to you. Information on assessment levels can be found on the department’s website.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">In certain circumstances you may be requested to complete a supplementary information form. You will be advised by the visa processing office if this is necessary.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Your application may be decided solely on the basis of information provided in this application. Failure to answer a
question may result in your application being refused if the decision-maker cannot be satisfied that you meet all of the
criteria for grant of the visa. The provision of information to the department that is incorrect may result in cancellation of your visa if it is granted. If you need more space to answer any question, write the details on a separate sheet, sign it and attach it to the application form.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">You must provide all of the documentation necessary to support your application (originals or certified or notarised copies) and you must declare that you have done so. Failure to do so may result in your application being refused. The documentation required may vary depending on your Assessment Level and the subclass appropriate to your course of study. Information on documentation required is available on the department’s website. A decision on your application will be made on the basis of all the information you provide, your circumstances and the legal requirements that apply. If your circumstances change in any way after you make your application you must inform the department immediately. Failure to do so can lead
to cancellation of your visa (if it is granted).</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp"><b>Applicants who provide false or misleading information may either have their applications refused, or their visa permitting them to remain in Australia cancelled.</b> <br>If you:
<ul>
<li>are applying in Australia;</li>
<li>do not already hold a student visa; and</li>
<li>you are in Assessment Level 2, 3, 4 or 5</li>
</ul>

<div>Health requirements</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">All applicants must meet Australia’s health requirements. You and any family members included in this application may be required to undergo a chest x-ray and medical examination. Refer to form 1163i <i>Health requirement for temporary entry to Australia </i> for further details</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If applying outside Australia under Assessment Level 3, 4 or 5, you should not undertake your medical or x-ray examinations until advised to do so by the Australian Government office processing your visa application.</div>
<div>Members of your family unit</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The term ‘members of the family unit’ covers your spouse (including a de facto spouse) and dependent children of you or your spouse, who are unmarried and have not turned 18 years of age. School-age dependants are unmarried
dependent children of you or your spouse who have turned 5, but have not yet turned 18.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Members of your family unit may apply for visas that will allow them to join you in Australia. They may apply for visas at the same time as you, or after you have arrived in Australia and commenced your course of study. If you are in Australia and your family members intend to apply to join you after you have commenced your course, you will need to complete form 919 <i>Nomination of student dependant(s)</i>. You must send this form and other necessary documentary evidence to your family members for them to lodge at the relevant Australian Government office.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp"><b>Note:</b> If you are processed at Assessment Level 3, 4 or 5 and intend to undertake a course of 12 months or less in duration, members of the family unit are not permitted to accompany you to Australia on a student visa.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp"><b>All members of your family unit must be declared on your application form</b>, whether or not they intend to travel to Australia with you. A member who is not declared will not be eligible for entry to Australia as a family unit member, unless they were not your spouse or child at the time you lodged your application but have since become so.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">A school-age family unit member joining you in Australia is expected to attend school in Australia. You must provide evidence of enrolment for them if you wish them to be granted a student visa as a family unit member. You are responsible for their education costs in accordance with the charging policy of the relevant Australian state or territory.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Your spouse will have a condition placed on their visa that limits their period of study in Australia to a maximum of 3 months. If they wish to undertake study beyond this period they must apply for a student visa in their own right.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you are an AusAID or Defence-sponsored student, members  of your family unit must provide evidence of support by the relevant Minister for them to be granted a visa as your dependant.</div>
<div>‘No further stay’ conditions</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Your visa will be subject to a number of visa conditions. Information on these conditions can be found in the information form 1160i <i>Applying for a student visa</i> and on the department’s website.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">In certain circumstances, your visa may be subject to the ‘no further stay’ condition 8534 or 8535.</div>
<div>Condition 8534</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you are an Assessment Level 3, 4 or 5 student whose overall intended period of study is 10 months or less, you will usually be subject to this ‘no further stay’ condition. This means that after entering Australia, you may not be granted any other visa while you remain in Australia, other than a further student visa with permission to work or a Graduate – Skilled visa 1 . If you are an Assessment Level 3 student you may be exempt from the mandatory imposition of the ‘no further stay’ if you can show an additional A$12,000 and funds to cover living and school costs for a 12-month period in addition to the period of your intended study in Australia.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">A ‘no further stay’ condition may also be imposed on your visa, irrespective of your Assessment Level or period of study, if the decision maker considers this appropriate.</div>
<div>Condition 8535</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you are sponsored by the Australian Government or the government of your home country, you may be subject to this ‘no further stay’ condition. This means that after entering Australia, you will not be entitled to be granted any other visa while you remain in Australia apart from a further student visa with permission to work or a further student visa with the consent of your sponsor<sub>1</sub> .</div>
<div>Visa application charge</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Your completed application form, together with the correct visa application charge, can be lodged at the nearest Australian Government office if applying outside Australia, or at the nearest office of the department if applying in Australia. You can check the visa application charge with your nearest office of the department, or from form 990i Charges, which is available in the Forms section of the department’s website <b>www.immi.gov.au/allforms/</b></div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Payment must accompany your application and is generally not refunded if the application is unsuccessful. If you have paid enrolment or tuition fees, it is your responsibility to get a refund of these fees.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">To make a payment in Australia, please pay by credit card, debit card or by bank cheque or money order made payable to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. <b>Please do not pay by cash or personal cheque.</b></div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">For clients outside Australia, before you make a payment, please contact the Australian Government office to find out what methods of payment can be accepted at that office.</div>
<div>Authorisation of a person to only receive written communications</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">You may authorise another person to only receive all written communications about your application for a student visa with the department. That person will be known as your authorised recipient. To do this, you will need to complete Question 73 <i>Options for receiving written communications</i> and Question 75 <i>Authorised recipient details</i> in this form. The authorised recipient will need to sign at Question 77 Authorised recipient consent. You can only appoint one authorised recipient at any time. The department will communicate with the most recently appointed authorised recipient.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The department is required under section 494D of the <i>Migration Act 1958</i> (the Act) to send your authorised recipient any written communications relating to your application that would otherwise have been sent to you (but a copy of that communication may also be sent to you). If your authorised recipient agrees to it at Question 76, this communication may take place by fax or e-mail.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The department will send your authorised recipient only information which you are entitled to receive. For example, if you are a visa applicant and have a sponsor, your authorised recipient will not receive personal information about your sponsor, unless your sponsor also appointed the same authorised recipient.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you decide to change your nominated authorised recipient, after you have lodged this application, you must promptly advise the department in writing. You may use form 1231 Appointment of authorised recipient for this purpose, which is available from the department’s website <b>www.immi.gov.au/allforms/</b> or from any office of the department or Australian mission.</div>
<div>Authorisation of a migration agent to act on your behalf</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you have a migration agent acting on your behalf in relation to your application for a student visa, you need to complete Question 73 <i>Options for receiving written communications </i> and Question 78 <i>Agent details</i>. The migration agent will need to sign at Question 80 <i>Agent consent</i>.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Appointing a migration agent to act on your behalf includes authorising the department to:</div>
<ul>
<li>discuss your student visa application with the migration agent and seek further information from them; and</li>
<li>send your migration agent written communications about your student visa application that would otherwise have been 
sent to you.</li>
</ul>
<div class="visaInfo-descp"><b>Note:</b> Your migration agent will be your authorised recipient for written communication under section 494D of the Act and, in accordance with that same provision, you will be taken to have received any documents sent to them.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you change your migration agent or end his/her appointment, after you have lodged this application, you must promptly advise the department in writing, preferably by using form 956 <i>Appointment of a migration agent</i>, which is available on the department’s website <b>www.immi.gov.au/allforms/</b> or from your migration agent.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The department will communicate with your migration agent about your application, including your personal information such as health, police checks, financial viability and personal relationships. If your agent authorises it at Question 79 this communication may take place by e-mail or fax.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The department will send to your migration agent only information which you are entitled to receive. For example, if you are a visa applicant and have a sponsor, your agent will not receive personal information about your sponsor, unless your sponsor has also appointed the same migration agent.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">In some situations, departmental staff will need to speak with you directly rather than with your migration agent. For example, if you are applying for a visa the department may interview you. In some situations, the department will also send documents to you directly (for example, your passport) instead of to your migration agent, but it will inform your migration agent that it has done so.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you have appointed a migration agent to act for you, you are still responsible for the accuracy of information and supporting documentation that you give to your migration agent to forward to the department.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">When you provide the details of your migration agent, please
make sure you include their 7-digit:
<ul>
<li>migration agent registration number (if they are a registered migration agent); or</li>
<li>offshore agent ID number (if they have been allocated one by the department).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp"><b>Note:</b> Migration agents who operate overseas do not need to be registered. However, they may have been allocated an ID number by the department.</div>
<div>Using a migration agent</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">You are not required to use a migration agent. However, if you use a migration agent, the department encourages you to use a registered migration agent. Registered migration agents are bound by the Migration Agents Code of Conduct, which requires them to act in the lawful best interests of their clients and act professionally.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">A list of registered migration agents is available from the
Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) website
www.themara.com.au</div>

<div>Restrictions on giving immigration assistance</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">In Australia, anyone (including a lawyer) who uses knowledge of migration procedure to offer immigration assistance to a visa or cancellation review applicant, sponsor or nominator, must be registered, unless exempted from registration requirements by law. There are serious criminal penalties under Part 3 of the Act for breaching the law, including possible imprisonment if the unregistered person asks for, or receives, a fee or reward for their services.</div>
<div>Using an agent exempted from registration</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Certain people, such as officials, parliamentarians, diplomats, close family members (that is, only your spouse, child, adopted child, parent, brother or sister), sponsors and nominators, are able to provide you with immigration assistance as long as they do not ask or receive a fee or reward. If you wish to appoint an ‘exempted agent’, you must complete form 956 <i>Appointment of a migration agent</i>, which is available from the department’s website <b>www.immi.gov.au/allforms/</b> and attach it to this application form.</div>
<div>Applications for multiple visas</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you are a dependant applicant (for example, the spouse of a primary applicant) and you wish to appoint a different migration agent to the primary applicant, you must fill out a separate form 956 <i>Appointment of a migration agent</i>, which is available from the department’s website <b>www.immi.gov.au/allforms/</b> or advise the department in writing. Otherwise, the migration agent appointed by the principal applicant will have the authority to act for all persons included in the application.</div>
<div>Notification of giving immigration assistance</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Under section 312A of the Act, a registered agent has a duty to notify the department when lodging an application on behalf of a client, or within 28 days of commencing to act on behalf of a visa applicant. This notification can be done by completing, and your agent signing, the relevant sections of this application form.</div>
<div>Residential address</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">You must tell the department where you intend to live while your application is being dealt with. Failure to give a residential address will result in your application being invalid. A post office box address will not be accepted as your residential address.</div>
<div>Consent to communicate electronically</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The department may use a range of means to communicate with you. However, electronic means such as fax or e-mail will only be used if you indicate your agreement to receiving communication in this way.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">To process your application the department may need to communicate with you about sensitive information, for example, health, police checks, financial viability and personal relationships. Electronic communications, unless adequately encrypted, are not secure and may be viewed by others or interfered with. If you agree to the department communicating with you by electronic means, the details you provide will only be used by the department for the purpose for which you have provided them, unless there is a legal obligation or necessity to use them for another purpose, or you have consented to use for another purpose. They will not be added to any mailing list.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The Australian Government accepts no responsibility for the security or integrity of any information sent to the department over the internet or by other electronic means.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you authorise another person to receive documents on your behalf and they wish to be contacted electronically, their signature is required on the form to indicate their consent to this form of communication.</div>
<div>About the information you give to the department</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The department is authorised to collect information provided on this form under Part 2 of the Migration Act 1958. The information collected will be used for assessing your eligibility for a student visa to travel to and enter and/or remain in Australia, to monitor the conduct of migration agents, and for other purposes relating to the administration of the Migration Act.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The information collected might also be disclosed to agencies who are authorised to receive information relating to adoption, border control, business skills, citizenship, education, health assessment, health insurance, health services, law enforcement, payment of pensions and benefits, taxation, review of decisions and registration of migration agents. It will also be disclosed to any agency of the Australian Government, or of a state or territory, that is responsible for or otherwise concerned with the regulation of education providers.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">Relevant information about you will be disclosed to federal, state and territory police to assist in your location and possible detention in the event that you become an unlawful non-citizen. You will become an unlawful non-citizen if your visa ceases (for example, by cancellation for breach of visa condition) or expires and you do not hold another visa authorising you to remain in Australia.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">The information on this form, including the results of any tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), will be used to assess your health for an Australian visa. A positive HIV <b>or other</b> test result will not necessarily lead to a visa being denied. Your result(s) may be disclosed to the relevant Australian Government state and territory health agencies.</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">In addition, the relevant registered education provider(s) may be told whether or not your visa has been granted. The collection, access, storage, use and disclosure by the department of the information you provide in this form is governed by the <i>Privacy Act 1988</i> and, in particular, by the 11 Information Privacy Principles. The information form 993i <i>Safeguarding your personal information</i> gives details of agencies to which your personal information might be disclosed.

This form is available from the department’s website <b>www.immi.gov.au/allforms/</b> or from any departmental office or Australian mission overseas.</div>

Under the FOI Act you can apply for access to documents containing your personal information. You or someone authorised by you to access information on your behalf can apply to do this at any departmental office in Australia. There is no fee for accessing your own information. If you are overseas, you must also provide the Australian mission with an address in Australia to which copies of personal records can be sent. More information on how to make a request under the FOI Act is given on form 424A <i>Request for access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act</i> 1982 which is available from the department’s website
<b>www.immi.gov.au/allforms/</b> or from any departmental office or Australian mission overseas.</div>
<div>Review rights</div>
<div class="visaInfo-descp">If you apply for a student visa in Australia and you are refused the visa, you may apply for a review of the decision. You will be notified of your review rights in writing and the time limits for lodging such an appeal.</div>
